## Hello, I am Yihuai Hong, a third-year undergraduate student at South China University of Technology. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Language Models. 
## Starting from my second year, I am conducting research on the acceleration of Language Model's inference under the supervision of <a href="https://ziqianzeng.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Ziqian Zeng</a>. Meanwhile, in this summer I am visiting <a href="https://twitter.com/ucl_wi_group" style="text-decoration: none;">UCL Web Intelligence Group</a> & <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/research/groups-centres-and-sections/spacetimelab" style="text-decoration: none;">SpaceTime Lab</a> as a research intern with a focus on the area of Large Language Models, under the supervision of <a href="https://aldolipani.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Aldo Lipani</a>. 
## I am also looking for a 24's Ph.D. opportunity now :)

- We propose an early exiting method that can achieve consistency during training and inference by formulating the early exiting problem as a reinforcement learning problem.
- We propose a concept named Memorized Layer to measure the hardness of an instance. We incorporate it into the reward function to allow an instance to balance the accuracy and acceleration depending on individual hardness.
- The experimental results show that our method can outperform other baselines on natural language understanding and generation tasks.
